1. Gradient Clipping (gradient_clip_val)

This parameter has a significant impact. Low values generally perform better, but some trials also succeed with moderately high values.
Best Range: Values between 0.01 and 0.1 consistently yield good results. For example:
Trial 36 (best trial) used 0.134 and performed the best.
Trial 15 (2nd best) used 0.015.
Very high values (e.g., 58.8 in Trial 20) tend to underperform.

2. Hidden Size (hidden_size)

Lower hidden sizes generally perform well, particularly in the range of 18 to 46.
Best Range: Sizes between 18 and 46 tend to work best:
Trial 36 (best trial) used a hidden size of 18.
Trial 32 (2nd best) used a hidden size of 18.

3. Dropout (dropout)

Dropout also seems to be an important parameter for controlling regularization.
Best Range: Dropout values between 0.11 and 0.2 seem to be ideal.
Trial 36 (best trial) used a dropout of 0.177.
Trial 32 (2nd best) used a dropout of 0.140.

4. Hidden Continuous Size (hidden_continuous_size)

This parameter doesn’t seem to have a linear relationship with the performance, but moderate values perform better.
Best Range: Values around 11–13 tend to yield better performance:
Trial 36 used 12.
Trial 32 used 11.

5. Attention Head Size (attention_head_size)

Smaller attention head sizes seem to work best, especially values of 1 or 2.
Best Range: 1-2 attention heads tend to provide the best performance:
Trial 36 (best trial) used 1 head.
Trial 15 (second-best) used 1.

6. Learning Rate (learning_rate)

The learning rate plays a critical role in performance. Smaller learning rates around 0.03-0.05 tend to work well.
Best Range: 0.03-0.05 seems to be the most effective range:
Trial 36 used 0.0316.
Trial 32 used 0.0398.

Summary of Important Parameters:

Gradient Clip Val: Low to moderate values work best (0.01 to 0.1).
Hidden Size: Small sizes between 18 and 46 are ideal.
Dropout: Moderate dropout values between 0.11 and 0.2.
Hidden Continuous Size: Optimal between 11 and 13.
Attention Head Size: Lower is better, ideally 1 or 2.
Learning Rate: Learning rates around 0.03 to 0.05 give the best results.

These ranges are good starting points for further fine-tuning based on performance trends.
